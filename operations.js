/*Simple Operations
Ever wondered how many seconds there are in a month (30 days)?

Write a program to calculate and output the answer.


Hint
Remember, there are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute.*/

/* 30 days
1 day = 24 hours
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds */

//your code goes here

console.log(((30*24)*60)*60);
